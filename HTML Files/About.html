    <p>I’m a second-year Bachelor of Computing student majoring in Software Engineering at Belgium Campus ITversity. I enjoy problem-solving and working collaboratively in team environments, especially when building creative and functional software solutions.
My technical toolbox includes HTML, CSS, JavaScript, C#, SQL, Microsoft Access, and tools like Visual Studio, VS Code, and SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS). I’ve participated in multiple group projects as part of my coursework, which have enhanced my collaboration and project management skills.
I’m currently exploring various areas of the tech field and eager to learn, grow, and contribute to real-world projects.</p>
